                    <p>We are a website where each user can upload products they no longer need, without expecting anything in return, just like a library of objects.</p>

                    <p>Our users are little soldiers fighting in the battle against climate change, applying what we call the three Rs: "Recycle, Reuse, and Reduce." Through our application, we aim to reduce production and, consequently, the waste generated from it. Additionally, we solve the problem of unused items by giving them a purpose and preventing them from collecting dust in other people's homes.</p>
                
                    <p>Every user who signs up for the application commits to taking the utmost care of all the objects, treating them as if they were their own.</p>
